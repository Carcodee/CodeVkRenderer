# Vulkan Engine Template


This project is a **Vulkan Engine** with a **RenderGraph** architecture that provides a base interface for rapid prototyping of graphics applications. 

The goal of this engine is to simplify and accelerate the development process by offering an easy-to-use framework, while still leveraging the full power of Vulkan's explicit API.

### Features
- RenderGraph-based architecture for flexible rendering pipeline setups (In progress)
- Modular Vulkan interface designed for rapid prototyping.
- Base renderer example (soon)

### Current Status
This project is **currently under development**. More features and improvements will be added in future updates.

### Getting Started
- Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions (coming soon).
- Basic usage and sample code will be provided in the examples section (coming soon).

Stay tuned for updates!
